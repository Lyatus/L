# L Engine

## About
L is a public-domain modular game engine.

## Building

`run.sh [build|run|open] [dbg|dev|rls]`

The `build` action will just build the engine (default configuration is development), while the `run` action will also run the [sample](./smp/), and the `open` action will open the Visual Studio project (Windows-only).
